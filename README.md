## Approach

1. **Iterate Through Menu Collections**: 
   - Loop through each menu collection object in the array.

2. **Loop Through Categories**: 
   - For each menu collection, iterate through its categories array.

3. **Match IDs**: 
   - Compare the IDs in the `menuItemsIds` array of each category with the IDs of the items in the `menuItems` array.

4. **Extract Items**: 
   - If there's a match, extract the corresponding menu item from the `menuItems` array and associate it with the category.

5. **Repeat**: 
   - Continue this process for all menu collections and categories.

6. **Organize Data**: 
   - Store or organize the extracted items based on their categories.
